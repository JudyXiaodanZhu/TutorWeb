# Project Proposal

## Topic

* **Topic:** Tutor Website for U of T students.

* **Purpose:** Allow students to connect with other students (tutors) in order to get help for courses they are enrolled in.

* **Users:**  In theory, the target users should be all students from U of T. However, for the purpose of demonstration, the users for this Application will be U of T Computer Science students.

* **What users can do:** There are three different types of users: Admin, Tutor and Student. On a high level, users can use the website to chat 1-on-1 with other users, post thoughts about courses and search for tutors for courses. 


## List of the user interactions

For different users, there are different kinds of user interactions. All users can search for tutors based on tutor name/ course /rating, create user profile, view tutor profile, post threads under a course and chat with other students/tutors who want to connect and set times and places to meet up. Users can post in forums regarding a specific course that allows them to get answers from other students (not tutors) quickly.
 * Admin: The admin user (the project team) can edit and delete postings under the courses, manage all user profiles and chat with other users to handle user complaints. For example, if a conflict arise between the student and the tutor, the admin must intervine and help resolve the conflict. 
 * Tutor: Users can sign up to be a tutor by creating a tutor profile which showcases their qualifications for a course.
 * Students: Students can edit their own profile and sign up to be a tutor whenever they like. 


## Getting data into application

* **Profile:** Information given by user, when they sign up.

* **Posts / Messages:** all based on user input.

* **Course Information:** We will scrape the course data from the U of T Arts & Science course offerings website and input that data into the database. Therefore, when the user signs up to be a tutor they can select the courses they want to tutor from a static list, given by our database.
